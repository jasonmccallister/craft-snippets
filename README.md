## Craft CMS Snippets

This is an Atom package to aid in speeding up your Craft CMS development by providing snippets for common code used when developing for Craft.

**Important Note**: The way Atom handles snippets may be a little different than other editors. When working with this package, the beginning of the document must have `<?php` for the snippets (developer) to work.
