## Craft Snippets

Atom package to speed up your Craft plugin and website development. I will start adding more support for template coding in a future release.

**Important Note**: The way Atom handles snippets may be a little different than other editors. When working with this
package, the beginning of the document must have `<?php` for the snippets (developer) to work.
